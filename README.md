# traffic-tracker

This repository uses GitHub Actions to regularly store traffic data for the [HHS-AHRQ repositories](https://github.com/HHS-AHRQ).

GitHub traffic stores data for only the last 2 weeks. This repository contains spreadsheets of snapshots of traffic data, starting in May 2023 (or initialization of repository, whichever comes later).
